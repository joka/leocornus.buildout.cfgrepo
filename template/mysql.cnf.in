# Example MySQL config file for small systems.
#
# This is for a system with little memory (<= 64M) where MySQL is only used
# from time to time and it's important that the mysqld daemon
# doesn't use much resources.
# 
# MySQL programs look for option files in a set of
# locations which depend on the deployment platform.
# You can copy this option file to one of those
# locations. For information about these locations, see:
# http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/option-files.html
#
# In this file, you can use all long options that a program supports.
# If you want to know which options a program supports, run the program
# with the "--help" option.
#
# This file is based the the sample config files from MySQL build,
# under folder mysql-build/support-files.
# There are more samples from that folder.
#
# The details document for all setting variables used here 
# could be find in MySQL documentation:
# http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/server-system-variables.htm
